In a far distant world, there is a hero named Saitama and with just one punch he can paralyze his enemies for a certain period.
Saitama is fighting Garou and is hitting him at certain points in time represented by a sorted array. After each punch, Garou is
paralyzed for a certain duration of time represented by an integer. Your task is to find the total duration of time Garou will be in a paralyzed state. 


Input:
2 (testCases)
3 2 (size and K)
1 4 6 (array)
3 2 (size and K)
1 2 6 (array)

Output:

Solution:
import java.util.*;
  import java.io.*;
  
  public class Main {
    public static void main(String args[]) throws IOException {
      
      //write your code here
      Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
      int t = sc.nextInt();
      while(t--!=0){
        int size = sc.nextInt();
        int[] arr = new int[size];
        int k = sc.nextInt();
        for(int i=0;i<size;i++){
          arr[i]=sc.nextInt();
        }
        int sum=0;
        int next=0;
        for(int i=0;i<size;i++){
          if(next>=arr[i]){
            int temp = arr[i]-next+k-1;
            next+=temp;
            sum+=temp;
            
          }else{
            sum+=k;
            next=arr[i]+k-1;
          }
          
        }
        System.out.println(sum);
      }
      
    }
  }
